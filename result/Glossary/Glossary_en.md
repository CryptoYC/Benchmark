## Quick glossary

This quick glossary contains a number of related terms in the CryptoYC Benchmark test report. These terms are used in reports, so bookmark them for quick reference.

- Block Block

A block is a collection of information (block headers) about the transactions involved.

- Blockchain Blockchain

A series of blocks verified by the proof of work system, each block is connected to its predecessor, up to the creation block.

- Witch attack Sybil attack
  

A form of attack that acts on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. An attacker uses a single node to forge multiple identities in a P2P network, thereby reducing network redundancy, reducing network robustness, and monitoring or interfering with normal network activity.

- BGP hijacking attack BGP hijacking
  

Bgp hijacking refers to the route that an attacker maliciously changes Internet traffic. Attackers do this by falsely claiming ownership of IP address groups (called IP prefixes) that they do not actually own, control, or route. Bgp hijacking is like someone changing all the signs on the highway and pointing the car at the wrong exit.
    
- DDos attack DDoS attack

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks refer to the use of client/server technology to combine multiple computers as an attack platform to launch DDoS attacks on one or more targets, thereby multiplying denial of service attacks. power.
    
- Network Split Attack Network Split Attack
  

Divide the network into two or more parts so that any duplicate transactions on the smaller chain will be lost.
    
- Long-range attack
  

The attacker created a long blockchain branch starting from the creation block and tried to replace the current legal backbone.

- Short-range attack
  

The attacker tampering with data from the last few blocks.
    
- TPS

The number of transactions/transactions processed per second.
    
- Compile Compiling

Convert code written in a high-level programming language (such as Solidity) to a low-level language (such as EVM bytecode)

- Consensus Consensus
  

A large number of nodes, usually most of the nodes on the network, have the same block in their best verified local blockchain. Do not confuse with consensus rules.
    
- Consensus rules Consensus rules


The block verification rule that the full node follows in order to be consistent with other nodes. Don't be confused with consensus.

- Decentralized autonomous organization DAO


Decentralised Autonomous Organization. There are no hierarchical management companies and other organizations. It may also refer to a contract called "The DAO" released on April 30, 2016, which was hacked in June 2016 and eventually ignited a hard fork (code DAO) in the 1,192,000 blocks. , restored the DAO contract that was attacked, and led to the two competitive systems of Ethereum and Ethereum.

- Decentralized app DApp
  

Decentralised Application. In a narrow sense, it is at least a smart contract and web user interface. More broadly, DApp is a web application based on open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services. In addition, many DApps include decentralized storage and/or messaging protocols and platforms.
    
- Difficulty Difficulty
  

Network-wide settings that control how much computation is required to produce a workload.

- Digital signature Digital signature


The digital signature algorithm is a process in which a user can use a private key to generate short string data called a "signature" for a document, so that anyone with a signature, a document, and a corresponding public key can verify (1) the file is The owner of the particular private key is "signed" and (2) the file has not been altered since it was signed.

- hash value Hash
   

A fixed length fingerprint generated for variable size data by a hash method.

- Network Network
  

Spread transactions and blocks to the peer-to-peer network of each node (network participant).
    
- Reentry Attack Re-entrancy Attack


This attack can be repeated when the Attacker contracts call the method of the Victim contracts. Let's call it victim.withdraw(), call the victim.withdraw() method again, and recursively call itself before the original call to the contract function is completed. Recursive calls can be implemented through a fallback method of the attacker's contract. The only trick an attacker must perform is to interrupt the recursive call before running out of gas and to avoid the stolen ether being restored.

- Nakamoto Satoshi Nakamoto
  

Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of the individual or team that designed Bitcoin and its original implementation of Bitcoin Core. As part of the implementation, they also designed the first blockchain. In the process, they were the first to solve the double payment problem of digital currency. Their true identity is still a mystery.
    
- Vitalik Buterin
  

Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer, co-founder of Ethereum and Bitcoin magazine.
    
- Gavin Wood
  

Gavin Wood is a British programmer, co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum. In August 2014 he presented Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.
    
- SHA
  

Secure Hash Algorithm, a series of cryptographic hash functions issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

- Smart Contract Smart Contract

A program executed on the calculation framework of Ethereum.

- Solidity


A procedural (instructive) programming language with syntax similar to Javascript, C++ or Java. The most popular and most commonly used language for Ethereum Smart Contracts. First created by Gavin Wood (co-author of the book)

- Test Network Testnet


A test network (referred to as testnet) is used to simulate the behavior of the main network of the main network.

- Turing Complete Turing Complete


In computational theory, if a data manipulation rule (such as a computer's instruction set, programming language, or cellular automaton) can be used to simulate any Turing machine, it is called Turing complete or computationally common. The concept is named after British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.

- Node Node

Participate in the software client of the peer-to-peer network.

- Wallet Wallet


Software that has all your keys.
