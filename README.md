# What is it?

> Greed has led many projects to easily raise millions of dollars without due diligence -- "Why Charlie Munger rejects digital assets?" 

In order to allow investors to transparently understand the technical situation of a blockchain project, we have conducted research on consensus, security, performance, technological innovation, code and economic models, and launched the CryptoYC Benchmark of the blockchain project. Referred to as "Benchmark").

If you have any comments or ideas, please contact us or join the technical community. Thank you very much :heart:
