## Seven blockchain security attacks

Distributed denial of service (DDoS)

Hit the network with a large amount of traffic or t-connection requests, so that all available network resources are exhausted

2. Sybil attack

An attack form that acts on a P2P network. An attacker uses a single node to forge multiple identities in a P2P network, thereby reducing network redundancy, reducing network robustness, and monitoring or interfering with normal network activity.

3. Long term attack

The attacker created a long blockchain branch starting from the creation block and tried to replace the current legal backbone.

4. Short term attack

The attacker tampering with data from the last few blocks.

5. BGP hijacking attack (BGP hijacking)

BGP hijacking refers to the route that an attacker maliciously changes Internet traffic. An attacker does this by erroneously announcing ownership of an IP address group (called an IP prefix) that they do not actually own, control, or route.

6. Network Split Attack

Divide the network into two or more parts so that any duplicate transactions on the smaller chain will be lost.

7. Buffer Overflow Attack

Attacks exploited by a buffer overflow vulnerability.
